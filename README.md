# DeepForest

A simple implementation in python of the method proposed by Zhi-Hua Zhou and Ji
 Feng in their paper "Deep Forest: Towards An Alternative to Deep Neural 
 Networks". You can check their article [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.08835.pdf)

 The implementation is based on the great work of the Scikit-learn library. The 
 API is built upon the scikit way of doing data science, by defining object with 
 fit and predict methods. Some example will be provided soon...
